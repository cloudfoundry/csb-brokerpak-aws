# AWS Brokerpak

A brokerpak for the [Cloud Service Broker](https://github.com/pivotal/cloud-service-broker) that provides support for AWS services.

## Development Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - tooling provided as docker images
* make - covers development lifecycle steps

A docker container for the cloud service broker binary is available at *cfplatformeng/csb*

## AWS account information

To provision services, the brokerpak currently requires AWS access key id and secret. The brokerpak expects them in environment variables:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Development Tools

A Makefile supports the full local development lifecycle for the brokerpak.

Make targets will run with the *cfplatformeng/csb* docker image. Make sure your local image is up to date or run

`docker pull cfplatformeng/csb` to update it

Alternatively, a custom image can be specified by setting the `CSB` environment variable

Available targets include (but are not limited to):

- `make` list make targets
- `make build` build the brokerpak
- `make run` runs the brokerpak locally
- `make docs` will generate markdown documentation from brokerpak
- `make run-examples` will run example provision, bind, unbind, deprovision against broker started with `make run`

There is a make target to push the broker and brokerpak into a CloudFoundry foundation. It will be necessary to manually configure a few items for the broker to work.

- `make push-broker` will `cf push` the broker into CloudFoundry. Requires the `cf` cli to be installed.

The broker gets pushed into CloudFoundry as *cloud-service-broker-aws*  It will be necessary to bind a MySQL database to the broker to provide broker state storage. See [AWS Installation](./docs/aws-installation.md) docs for more info.
